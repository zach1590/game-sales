1,"muito bom, vc pode construir, usar sua imaginação, mods, sobreviver, jogar multiplayer e até zerar o jogo! minecraft é um jogo incrível e fica melhor a cada atualização, (nunca zerei mesmo depois de muitos anos)"
1,"Jogo incrível, muito divertido, e com amigos fica ainda mais legal."
1,baby gammeeee \n                     \n                     had the most fun playing when it was first released sory\n                     \n                     still fun for a couple of hours when playing with people tho! 
1,Minecraft is what you make of it. Unfortunately theres no reason to do anything. 
2,"Bom jogo, importante pra caramba e tudo mais, mas, sinceramente, tantas horas de gameplay me divertiram muito, mas me recepcionaram na história. Não que eu eu esperasse algo muito elaborado, mas senti que não foi conclusiva ou evoluísse os personagens. É divertido, muito mesmo, e a liberdade é ótima. Passei muito tempo jogando tênis, dirigindo pelas colinas, fazendo coisas aleatórias, e a experiência é ótima. Em pleno começo de 2023, talvez não seja lá grande coisa jogar um jogo assim no sentido de muita coisa legal pra fazer, mas na época era uma baita inovação e merece respeito pelo que até hoje impressiona. "
2,I really wanted to love this game more. The playing world is stunning with colorful and great recreations of actual locations and landmarks. Having to juggle between 3 characters is a brilliant idea. But I found the story to be a bit lackluster and overall I did not feel as involved with the protagonists as much as I was with the previous game.
2,People be rating this a 3.... BITCH BE SERIOUS!
2,i cannot picture a world where someone gives this less than a 10
2,"incredible spectacle and movie esque cutscenes backed up by memorable characters. inarguably one of the most recognizable games of the decade, however is held back by lackluster gameplay."
3,this game is so addicting for the most random reason
3,"Bem simples mas exige bastante estratégia e sorte, mesmo não curtindo muito seu gênero consigo me divertir um pouquinho, vale a pena jogar pelo valor histórico."
3,"Hard tetris game to go wrong with, albeit not as iconic as the game boy version. The A-type is your classic endless game of tetris, and the B-type involves clearing a certain amount of garbage blocks. Plays by 'asshole tetris' rules, where blocks are pure random so you can get completely screwed by RNG. My major gripe with this game is the controls. Moving blocks left to right is very slow and it feels like the blocks rotate in a way where I keep accidentally misplacing them. No hard drops either. I respect the people that play this competitively for learning how to master the controls, because I sure as hell had a hard time. Getting the ending of the game by clearing a level 9 speed 5 height B game is a total crap shoot due to the RNG of what blocks you get and the arrangement of the garbage blocks, so just stick to the A-game. Not my favorite version of tetris but still does the job."
3,"A great colorful port of the arcade classic, featuring two game modes."
3,Fucking love Tetris. Timeless game.
3,HOOOOOLY FUUUUUCK
4,"One of the best party games, and a solid single player game"
4,if you have touched a controller you probably already know what this is and have already played it. I personally never got the hype and preferred wii play back in the day but maybe that's just me being a PLAYER and not a gross SPORTSER. the OST do be raw tho
4,best game ever i really love it slay
4,"I used to work in a nursing home that had a wii bowling league, and a team of 5 ladies who we actually recorded and submitted to a national tournament.\n                     \n                     So shout out to Dot and her perfect game,  and to the wonderful team in 2013, you all did great!"
4,the only sports I care about
4,"the perfect arcade game. Another type of game theyll never make again."
5,"I don't think I played this for more than an hour, if that. I tried it out in... 2020, maybe? It felt extremely outdated and wasn't fun at all. Compared to every other BR I've played over the past few years, this one was easily the weakest."
5,the game which spawned a fucking genre is ironically very bad.
5,Friendly fire is so funny dawg
5,"Gaming experience is unsatisfying. Funny enough this whole new Genre got so much hype. But being honest, this game has so many issues, gameplay wise as well as from a technical point of view."
5,no discernable visual difference from ipad version
6,"I actually had no idea this game was so long, I tought it only had like 4 worlds, now I understand why this was so revolutionary back in the day. Can't deny I had a good time with it, beat it in around 1 and a half hour, using save states, because this must have been a burden to finish in 1985"
6,"Can't deny that the game did a lot for the platformer genre, but nowadays I don't really consider it anything special.\n                     \n                     But it has the most iconic first stage of any platform game ever."
6,"Entendo a importância desse jogo pra industria mas não, ele definitivamente não é bom."
6,Best 6 minutes ever
6,I mean aye sure. 1-1 is five stars for being iconic.
7,"this game goes HARD. The gameplay is a bit on the simple side of things with drifting for every turn being pretty much the status quo, but it's also so smooth and polished that it's not really an issue. Visually it looks phenomenal, it's probably one of the best looking wii U games. There's a reason why they just brought this over to the switch rather than making a new game, as trying to top this would be a feat in its own. why was the case red tho?"
7,200cc is the insanity and chaos that i live for
7,Fun game that is revived on the switch
7,only if it was shiny
7,DOLPHIN SHOALS\n                     \n                     ELECTRODOME\n                     \n                     BIG BLUE\n                     \n                     MOUNT WARIO\n                     \n                     ALL DA BEST TRACKS
7,"Including the DLC, this game is 4 stars, without it, it's about 3. This game has no battle mode which is a massive deal breaker for me and a lot of the roster has been completely shaken up with a lot of characters I frankly do not care about. It's a good game, but the gravity gimmick is not impactful or worth being marketed as a gimmick at all. The racing controls are great though, and this game's online is\n                     \n                      chefs kiss\n                     \n                     beautiful. It is what saves this game from being boring after the first week. On 8 I grinded to 10k points online, and would have continued if not for the announcement of Deluxe. Fun game, removes a lot of things I do care about, but added a few things that make up for it. Play Deluxe instead."
8,Eu posso parecer um cara maluco mas realmente adoro a primeira geração e acho que nunca vão supera-la
8,"red version is okay i guess, but it's unfortunately no blue version"
8,Growing up and finding out how broken this game is really adds charm to the experience
8,If you put a hamburger in the gameboy a message appears saying 'Ash ate a hamburger'
8,red/blue is really the only one you need to play.
8,Bag is too short
8,"blue version better, blastoise is so cool"
8,I got this at a yard sale for a quarter back in 2007. Best investment I ever made
8,"It makes several smart choices and integrates them so seamlessly it took Pokémon Go removing the soul of the franchise for them to become apparent. In fact, gen 1 -and consequently 2- have aged considerably better than subsequent generations."
8,"Nearly 25 years ago, a game about raising pocket monster friends made it's way overseas to spread joy to western countries."
8,"Any Gen before 4 & 5 has aged badly in terms of gameplay mechanics. If you want to play it once to see what the series was like at the time that's fine, but the music & sprites have aged terribly. If not for Gen 2 improving almost everything, interest for Pokemon would've quickly died out"
9,overrated as fuck
9,"I wanna be a cowwwboyyyy, baby..."
9,shoutout rockstar
9,Sacrifices fun for the sake of realism
9,First playthrough was an incredible experience.
9,Dutch has a plan
10,It’s 2d Minecraft and I wish it had that extra d
10,terraria > Minecraft
10,Rating: 9.2/10 - Amazing
10,re-logic i am begging you please make the actual final update
10,Play Minecraft.
10,uncontested standard for this game genre . bitches got everything right down to the exact feel of everything
11,Great for the family
11,I lost 30 pounds after a year
11,Never been so addicted to exercising
12,Bundling this gem with the OG Game Boy was the best marketing move of all time.
12,this game is truly fantastic
12,"its literally tetris. like the most tetrisy tetris that could ever tetris. you think about tetris, 90% chance this version is the first one you think of unless ur like a weird comp player or something and u think of grand master or whatev. This game controls kinda weirdly ngl, with the blocks feeling oddly sticky which makes playing at higher speeds pretty difficult. it's still tetris though, and when the heck has tetris ever been bad in the history of the universe. The multiplayer is also fun, featuring some of the most off model versions of mario and luigi your eyes will ever see."
12,"there's about a hundred different versions of Tetris that are better than this one but in spite of that Tetris on the Gameboy still holds up. Like there's nothing bringing you back to this version other than nostalgia or wanting to experience the classic version for the first time, but Tetris is Tetris. It is still the fun puzzle game that anyone can pick and up and understand. Mindlessly addicting despite of its age."
12,Downloaded this on my TI 84 calculator and would play it mindlessly during classes in highschool
13,"One of the all time classics, and with good reason. It's pac-man, do I really need to explain what this game is? eat dot, get chased by ghost, big dot means you can eat ghost. The concept is addicting but I believe the true reason why this game popped off hard was due to its character. No longer were you shooting aliens in a generic spaceship, you were a character with a name getting chased by other characters with names and even their own personalities. I don't know if this was the first game EVER to do such a thing (probably not), but it was the first to do it and really explode in popularity. The power dynamic flipping whenever you get a power pellet is also a pretty cartoony mechanic in its own right which makes the game just have this cartoonish charm. There's also very basic cutscenes every couple of levels that give a decent break in the action. Pac man is cool, one of the most classic arcade games of all time."
13,Literal definition of mid. But I could see this being pretty fun with friends.
13,more like mid man
13,Crazy how that man is pac
13,"love the little ghosts, theryre so cute!"
13,timeless
14,"eh. it was definitely fun at first, but that's kinda the only reason i didn't rate it lower, actually. the online multiplayer has an awful loading time for each person joining or leaving your island, the villagers have little to no personality, it doesn't feel like there's much incentive to keep playing and i end up just neglecting my island after a while before dropping the game altogether. not a slight at animal crossing fans, i just don't think this was worth $60."
14,Wish I'd played it a lot more
14,"Got it day 1 during lockdown and I had a blast with it. I played this game every single day of the week for hours, however when I paid off my debt to Tom Nook and my house was complete there was nothing else to do. I eventually got bored of the game and retired."
14,this wasn't good for my adhd
14,"Came in clutch during the start of lockdown, but had a disgustingly small amount of content on launch. Epitomises issues with modern games. But I'd probably have topped myself without that singing wee frog guy."
14,"my first animal crossing game,i liked it"
15,shani casa-te comigo por favor
15,Some horrible fights but goddamn that story. And Shani is best female character after ciri
15,"Hearts of Stone presents a very engaging tale with tightly paced story and very memorable characters, it may live in Blood and Wine's shadow but this is without a doubt a fantastic expansion through and through with what is probably the peak of the Witcher saga storytelling in both writing and cinematics."
15,terrific writing and pacing.
15,Loved the plot.
15,"So... They made a dlc that is somehow have excellent pacing, story that makes you think, characters to admire, have lots of new bosses as well...."
16,Hilarious
16,What I really appreciate is that there are multiple solutions to almost every puzzle.
16,It's just dumb fun...
16,Human: Fall Flat is like if your drunk uncle decided to design a video game.
17,Completed to fulfill a childhood dream and it's genuinely fun racing. Grand prix mode can be infuriating if you're trying to get star ratings though
17,the worst Mario Kart. The sort of thing a reprobate would come up with for fun. Motion controls can die.
17,Solid Mariokart entry but I always found myself going back to Double Dash.
17,skill issue
17,"It's the wii one! Everyone's played this one! It's a fun mario kart, I don't really like the motion controls but it DOES have funky kong! Funky music too!"
17,I used to deeply dislike Mario Kart Wii. The controls felt unresponsive and wrong and the item balancing seemed nonexistent to me.
18,I love going around in the plane to find all the destinations
18,Spent countless hours golfing around the island
18,Sword fighting was so intense!
18,Is a classic!
19,Fun game with fun power ups. I just wish these new super Mario bros games used different sounds from game to game. This one feels a lot different than the Wii U one as far as the levels go but it sounds exactly the same so it tricks my brain into it feeling even less standout than it already is. This scratched my Mario itch though so good job guys who made this.
19,"laughed til I cried griefing my friends both accidentally and intentionally. please play with friends, it's so much better"
19,"Eu nao costumo jogar jogo de plataforma,pq primeiro q sou ruim e segundo q geralmente me deixa puto.\n                     \n                     É divertido,mas vou te falar viu.\n                     \n                     A pessoa q fez o castelo do bowser com aquele corredor infinito merece um cacete e nao só isso,como tbm por ter feito a batalha final ser contra o tempo."
19,"Can't say I remember too much about this one, but it started a war and now we will never get another 2D mario game again. Thanks Nintendo."
19,"I sincerely believe that people would like New Super Mario Bros. a lot more if we hadn't gotten three god damn sequels. Because by its own merits, this one is super unique and creative. Sure, the general world ideas are kinda boring (grass, desert, ice etc), but the leveldesign is absolutely top notch."
19,it's still not mind blowing but it's kinda insane how much of a glowup this is compared to what we got in the good old days and how well it still holds up in general
20,man why they gotta leave weegee out of the balloon
20,"I remember playing this with friends a lot, and it's very nostalgic for me. The disc eventually stopped playing a few minutes into the game, but it was loved."
20,"I will never forgive this game for starting the whole Wii/Wii U Mario blandness era. New Super Mario Bros. DS was fun, unique and creative. This one makes me shudder in disgust, because it was the first of what would be three New Super Mario Bros. sequels. It represents everything wrong with the boring age of Mario games in the late 2000s/early 2010s."
20,it's very in character for 2D mario to pump out something that's actually super good then immediately ruin it by taking inspiration from some of my least favorite places in the franchise
20,✅80%
20,Memories :)
21,"Wouldn't have got through lockdown without this fellow. Genuinely fantastic multiplayer CoD. You did the business for me when I needed you most. Warzone can fuck right off, but the sniping on the multiplayer was fab. Having an orange gun called Penny Arcade, come ON."
21,"(Played before 2023)\n                     \n                     The engines gameplay and combat is SO much better than the original games, and was really needed. The campaign had a lot of cool levels, especially stealth and raid ones. I also really enjoyed the multiplayer too but this game felt so streamlined I just didn't really see as much of a soul, and the story was definitely not as exciting or dramatic. Nothing really interesting happened honestly. Definitely was fun to play and a breath of fresh air for the yearly series."
21,the correct take is this is an actual top 5 cod even with all the poop from a butt maps and balancing the multiplayer had
21,"Modern Warfare 2019 was a bit of a reentry into the COD-osphere for me. After many formative years spent with the franchise I got a bit fatigued with the lack of innovation and general oversaturation of the shooter market. The only reason I even gave this 2019 reboot a try was because for the first time in a long time, the clips I saw of the game actually made me want to play it. And after playing the game enough to unlock the mastery camo for ALL weapons, I can confidently say I do not regret that decision. If nothing else can be said, Modern Warfare is one of the nicest feeling shooters I’ve ever played. The buttery smooth movement, new features (finishers, NVGs, gunfight mode, doors), and revamped animations really breathed life into a long-retired franchise for me."
21,oiii cappn proice enemies kill
21,these guys cant make a good game hackers are absolutely everywhere
22,Ive been playing Diablo games since the late 90s. Believe me when I tell you that the Switch version is awesome
22,Great game . I played alot of mmos games . This is a game where if you want a break for intense grinding of everything you can pick up this game kill stuff pick up gear along the way that you can also share with others and grind notalgic easy to play
22,"Initially, I gave in to peer pressure and downloaded d3.   I was pissed  off to the max, when I first started with a monk character.  I actually surprised myself because it was thoroughly captivated! Graphics are a bit more 'darker' than previous versions, but seems to fit gameplay to a `t`"
23,"I feel like a wet rat in a bathtub when I play this game, take that as you will."
23,"I've tried playing this game. For 80 hours. I stopped after I was bored to death and still unsure I was actually following the actual storyline, or if there even was any."
23,it will be hard for there to ever be a better feeling open world. combat is not so interesting and mods will carry most of the experience past like 150 hours at most though
23,I have had a lot of fun in Skyrim just wandering around and making up my own story in my head but the moment I run into fully authored quests my enjoyment dips vastly
23,"special edition da anniversary edition da bunu da oynadım, tam olarak eşi yok sanırım. eşi yok demez bu oyun inanilmaz harika demek degil, sadece aynı özgürlük ve immersionu veren bir oyun bulamadım. keske ilk oynadıgım zamanlara geri dönebilsem."
23,Everyone got their game day of release but amazon delivered mine 4 days late and that honestly killed my ability to get excited about anything for the rest of my life. Felt iconic at the time though didn't it.
24,Recomendadisimo (aunque 'el modo historia' no lo llamaria asi XD)
24,i hate it but i love it !
24,I'm a Captain Falcon main sadge
24,"hide your children. do not let them go anywhere near the smash bros. community, and as adults, you still do not let them go anywhere near the smash bros. community. fun casual game, please take casual showers."
24,Sakurai u gotta stop doing this to urself
24,"It is without a doubt the definitive version of a well-refined formula. I just never had fun playing any of the games in the franchise. I bought this one hoping the solo mode would deliver, unfortunately it's never-ending grind with very little payoff."
25,this game is the game (that is not CS:GO) that I have played the most ever. I have played this game for 400 hours.
25,"A really good switch game, however didn't really grip me like mario odyssey"
25,"i was very disappointed by the final boss fight, but the rest of the game is so good it makes me not want to even do the final boss fight anyway just so i can play more of the game. i do wish that there were more unique mechanics in combat besides just parrying and link's flurry rush, but the world is really pretty and actually incentivizes exploring it. characters are great, story is great and makes you work for it, and there's tons of hidden secrets and details."
25,em 105 horas de jogo não houve um segundo que eu não tava me divertindo e eu acho que isso diz muito
25,"Sencillamente el mejor juego que he tenido el placer de disfrutar, esperé 5 años para poder jugarlo y puedo decir que valió cada segundo la espera. No estoy ni cerca de conseguir el 100%, tengo mas de 100 horas y aún estoy descubriendo cosas nuevas. Va más allá de un simple juego, es una experiencia que lamentablemente solo se puede vivir una vez en la vida y la recomiendo totalmente."
25,"em meio a tanto jogo de mundo aberto ruim saindo por aí na última década, acho que da pra entender porque breath of the wild chocou tanto as pessoas no ano em que ele lançou. E realmente eu acho que é o melhor mundo aberto que eu já joguei até hoje, explorar cada pedacinho desse mundo é TÃO GOSTOSO, parece que tudo aqui tá no mapa tem um propósito para estar lá, diferente dos mapas vazios da ubisoft por exemplo. Acho que o unico defeito é esses sistema chatinho de durabilidade das armas, ficar trocando de arma o tempo todo é tão chato, espero que no próximo não tenha."
26,real gamer girls played silver
26,only speedran the game because music was fun
26,"I would say this game is timeless, except it has an absolutely atrocious level curve which makes parts of the game very grind heavy (minus half a star for that). Still, for a GBC game this is an incredible experience that really polishes the diamond in the rough that Gen 1 has."
26,"Pokemon peaked here, this is the only generation that actually tried to push the franchise forwards instead of retaining consistency throughout. Going back to Kanto on it's own is fantastic, but the best gaming moment of all time is going to fight Red in one of the most intense and challenging battles in the entire series."
26,Eu gosto mais do Lugia.
26,"Improves on almost everything wrong with Gen 1 both aesthetically & mechanically, but the core gameplay still suffer until Gens 4 & 5. Many new Pokemon are introduced like Sneasal that are useless untill Gen 4, meaning many will use goto powerful Pokemon to compensate for the terrible level curve when trying to beat the game. I had to use the cloning glitch to farm rare candies just to have decent levels for the Elite Four & Red."
26,"Foi bastante divertido, e realmente parece um 'Pokémon 2'"
26,Pokemon Crystal is the definitive version of the second generation Pokemon games. It takes what made Gold and Silver great and builds upon those games with additional features and tweaks.
26,masterpiece
26,bell tower feels like a place I've been before idk why\n                     \n                     oh yeah I had soulsilver when I was a kid lmao
26,Una notable mejora del Pokémon Oro/Plata en diversos aspectos.
27,Hate when the dog starts laughing at me
27,frustating but still fun
28,Wii Play is fun game that is worth the 10-15 dollars you can buy it from. But I think you will have fun with this game more than you will have fun with Wii Sports if you choose to play Single Player.
28,"My favorite game is Tanks! I like to control the tanks with the nunchuck. All and all, Wii Play is a game you will have fun with for a bit. A 9/10 in it's genre and an 8.5/10 overall."
28,"this game isn't that bad. I also got it cheap. Each game has enough fun to last about 30 minutes. This game is best for people who will play a game for a short time over and over again. While it may not be the best in the Wii series, it is not that bad, I give it a 8.5/10."
28,I have never played this game but it's pretty solid literally Find Mii is probably the best amongst the 9 overall this game is pretty memorable
29,Its hard to recommend this as a game but if you want a good story here it is.
29,the Walking Dead was a fantastic journey with a lot of interesting ideas of where point n clicks could go.
29,"Fun game! Made me cry, Never really reached the same highs as this season. 2 and 3 were a downward slope from her"
29,"Não foram poucos os momentos em que senti verdadeiramente que minhas escolhas estavam influenciando o desfecho do game, mesmo que subjetivamente. Isso foi o suficiente para me emocionar profundamente, como se realmente tivesse imerso nesse mundo."
29,"locura total cuando salió, la pasé hermoso"
30,I thank this game for my childhood introduction to classic rock.
30,top 5 games of all time
30,3 stars just for SAMP mod.
30,jogava mais pra ficar explodindo os outro o modo historia nunca me chamou a atenção
30,"I'll have two number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese, and a large soda."
30,I could happily spend the entire game just shopping in binco and suburban.
31,"Muito bom, um dos melhores plataformas e jogos do Super Nintendo. Muito revolucionário para sua época."
31,"Eu só zerei rapidão pelo caminho da estrela, mas esse jogo continua foda.\n                     \n                     Óbvio, não é meu Mario favorito, mas ele continua fodastico, um dos melhores jogos de plataforma 2D."
31,"i love mario games so much. i love super mario world's music, art, mechanics, level design, enemies...everything. this is just a nice game i could play with a friend watching or even as player 2, and it makes me happy."
31,"tão bom quanto o Bros 3 principalmente na música mas, o estilo do 3 e algumas outras coisas ainda me fazem preferir ele."
31,Long-review short: Masterpiece.
31,"A timeless classic. It might not be as shiny and frantic as its biggest competition at the time Sonic the Hedgehog, but its depth, size and replayability made it stand out. Still one of the all best in the Mario series."
32,super overhated
32,again xbox 360 was really fun
32,"Juego #55. Digan lo que digan, considero este un digno y muy épico final de la trilogía, supo aprovechar los cambios de la historia y de finalizarla de forma muy emocionante y frenética, ¡141 por siempre! >:D"
32,2nd best cod. survival lowkey better than zombies
32,Only played few sessions online with friends
32,the CoD of my childhood
33,res go ki da japanee!
33,amerika sikimde değil ama hikaye güzeldi
33,"Never played it in its prime, but I can only imagine how awesome the MP must have been in full lobbies. Campaign is great, zombies is good but overrated"
33,The best CoD. Banging campaign. Unreal multiplayer. The height of zombies. They've never nailed it better than this.
33,one of the most iconic COD games and thats for a good reason; the amount of effort poured into making this game is immeasurable.
33,"campaign was eh. zombies, however, slaps!"
34,"Hated this game when it came out, still hate it. Cringe dialogue and writing."
34,Buttstalion - gets me every time.
34,A decent looter shooter when you set the volume audio to zero.
34,Pre-sequel is just better in every way possible. Maybe except for endgame. But who plays single-player or even co-op shooting galleries for endgame. Pre-sequel at least got gun grinder and cool movement.
34,this was the funniest shit ever when it came out its kinda unfunny now but at the time this was peak 2010s humor and fun campy gameplay
34,Cammy Grounds type game. If you find this game funny I don't think we would get along.
35,"It was alright lol, my first mainline pokemon game and I had so much fun catching and exploring but the quality and graphics weren't the best."
35,bland pokemon game. why do you all keep buying these games.
35,"they didn't get to finish making this video game, but it DOES have perrserker in it, so, worth i guess"
35,It's good for a first time
35,"I think this game was a masterpiece in the Pokemon series, now I am not one to notice awful graphics, I just can't see it somehow. The story, music, Pokemon designs are astounding in my opinion, the only reason why this does not get a 5 star rating from me is because Zacian and Dracofish absolutely broke the competitive scene."
35,ya cute! there are better pokemon games but i think this was pretty fun
35,SpongeBob boat sound
35,None of y'all have any idea how annoying I was in 2018-19 talking about this series.
35,tried some new stuff which I liked. Probably too far gone for me though.
35,"y'know. Im sensing a pattern where I'm less compelled to be funny when talking about the pokemon games I really like. dunno why but I'm gonna roll with it"
35,it came home
35,not bad i found it really fun.. just painfully boring most of the time
36,"pokemon's honestly been going downhill since X and Y, it feels more like an obligated series per nintendo console rather than something gamefreak actually wants to make. the story was decent and the pokemon were alright, but i think this is where my interest in pokemon started dying down"
36,I don't remember this game very much but I had a little figure of the legendary Pokémon that came with the game
36,Just play ultra
36,Would probably be the best pre-switch pokemon game to actually play through if it wasn't bogged down worse than ever by a truckload of exposition for a plot small children yawn at.
36,"It's a good game, would be a shame if they released the same game but with more stuff like a year later"
36,I don't think we'll ever get a pokemon gen better than this one. peak creatures. peak region. solid character roster. great fashion options. peak music. peak anime. and of course peak games as well. and them immaculate 3DS vibes help too
36,Favorite Pokemon game of all time for the sole reason that it was my first one and nothing else (and the story is also really good)\n                     \n                     Objectively speaking it's kinda ass
36,I stood by this generation in 2016 and I still will today. Put some respect on Alola's name
36,incineroar my beloved
36,See 3D review.
36,i love this game very dearly and i am very glad i grew up with a 3DS because this game shaped me.. favorite pokemon game and region i live here in my mind
36,"Pokémon Sun is a game that if you were the target audience in 2016 (a child), you love a lot. Pokémon Sun is charming, cute, and a great way to experience the franchise. I give it a recommend if you are a child, however, for my non child readers, just play Scarlet/Violet"
37,Who the f design the sex in this one? Bob the builder? F***ing building corners.

37,"gta işte daha üzerine ne diyebilirim ki. son görevde motor ile helikoptere atladıktan sonra, helikoptere binmek için ard arda boşluk tuşuna bastığımız esnada oyun farklı açılardan gözüküyor bu nedenle helikoptere binemeden düşüyoruz ve görev başarısız oluyor. bu sorunu görev yöneticisi ayrıntılardan gta4ü seçerek tek çekirdekte çalıştırıp atlatabildim. helikoptere bindikten sonra tekrar tüm çekirdekleri aktifleştirin aksi halde oyun kasıyor."
37,Best story
37,"This game represents the thing I wasn't allowed to play, but did every now and then at a friends house. I have never actually sat and played this start to finish myself. I don't think I ever will. I'll keep the mystery there."
37,"Who the fuck at Rockstar thought mashing the A/X button to sprint would be a good idea, and why is that a feature in all of their games?"
38,i'm claiming cynthia for the gays
38,todas as vezes que eu tentei jogar esse jogo eu falhei miseravelmente pq por algum motivo os jogos de pokemon são muito lentos e eu acho que esse é mais. essa geração não é pra la essas coisas mas o giratina e a dimensão que eu esqueci o nome salvam o jogo pra mim
38,"I think this is my favorite pokemon game to play outside Colosseum. Dare I say it, it's a pretty good rpg???? Ill expand on my opinions when I replay it sometime but from what I remember team building in this game rock. Also nuzlocking it was a total blast I recommend it if you're looking for a challenge"
38,"O trio de iniciais é perfeito e os Pokemon no geral são incríveis; Lucario, Garchomp, Luxray, e etc....\n                     \n                     Depois de Kanto, a minha favorita."
38,"Meu primeiro contato com os monstrinhos da quarta geração, é uma região com ótimos elementos e várias opções para montar os seus times."
38,"this was my childhood pokemon game, and if you know what people on the internet say that means, then this should be my favorite out of the bunch. I logged like 300 or so hours in this as a kid just vibing and nowadays I barely play the series. While exploring the world and looking at the pokemon was fun for me, I never really got into the whole gameplay loop that much. If I didn't get this game around the same time as a toys r us event giving out free level 100 regigigas to players I probably wouldn't have actually finished this, as I just had that mfer carry me all the way to the end. It was still fun as a kid to be into the pokemon series, as through playing this with friends and trading pokemon/messing around with their action replay to get hacked pokemon I have fond memories playing this (even if i was bullied in school for carrying a phonebook-sized strategy guide for this game around with me). It's just that I've realized over time that I just don't like main series pokemon games, so this game has become inherently less special over time."
39,i remembered i beat it with warps
39,"i first played the GBA version when i was about 4 years old. still haven't beaten bowser. i have tried many times"
39,Literal pegar tudo que deu certo melhorar ainda mais e adicionar mais coisas novas tão incríveis quanto fez desse o melhor Mario 2D (até agora) pra mim. Fiz 100% e amei.
39,"An absolute classic and one of the all-time best, if not the all-time best, Mario platformers."
39,"It’s shocking how the mainline Mario series trailblazed so hard for the platformer genre and games as a whole in just its first few entries. The level themes may seem standard now but it’s important that this was the\n                     \n                      first\n                     \n                     major game to do the whole Grass-Desert-Water-Snow-Lava, etc. thing. Honestly a contender for best NES game period and absolutely holds up the most.\n                     \n                     My only complaint is that upon a replay, the levels were a lot shorter than I remembered and I wish some of the really cool power-ups (Hammer Suit) weren’t so hidden."
39,"The best part of SMB3 is throwing a hammer at Boom-Boom and having it make a million damage noises as it hits him, making it sound like you've harmed him so badly that you've retroactively deleted his entire lineage from history."
40,"A really great game, just didn't stick out as much as it's predecessor 64"
40,Inspiring how Mario can feel so fresh and original after so many years.
40,i played this game SO many times i dont ever wanna touch it again
40,I mean objectively the best Mario game I just like Galaxy more
40,"Yeah, Mario games HIT"
40,the first 3D Mario game I have truly loved and completed 100%. The near-perfection of an already glorious formula.
41,all of these pretentious mfs actin like this is the best cod. NO IT AINT !
41,"O melhor COD de todos? Com certeza, zerei em todas plataformas"
41,Not a scratch on Blops1 but it's fine.
41,the last good COD. nuff said.
41,Helllll yeah
41,"best cod and that’s not just nostalgia talking. campaign, multiplayer + league play, and zombies were all great"
42,"If you like playing with balls buddy, do I have the game for you."
42,"Very special FIFA to me because it is the first one where I played the Ultimate Team mode. Gameplay was extremely good too, Even though the l1+triangle passes worked a bit too well."
42,Mi primer FIFA
42,"O melhor FIFA de todos, desde jogabilidade até as musicas."
42,as músicas são memoráveis
42,"Definitivamente um dos maiores jogos já feitos, só música incrível na trilha."
43,The perfect game to be bundled with Kinect: funny and with a very good graphical side.
43,"Still, it's breezy, colourful presentation and general silliness make Kinect Adventures easy to like."
43,"lots of fun! my daughter and myself play for hours and it is fantastice excerscise! Great into. to the world of Kinect! A traditional sports game (skiing, volleyball?) would have been cool as well...Ther River Rapids is amazing!"
43,"Kinect Adventures is a typical tech-demo that comes free with new hardware. It's instantly fun and demonstrates what Kinect can do, but you've seen everything in an hour and it won't take long for you to stop playing altogether. It works though, and for that it's already a fun little game to have. Make the sequel a bit longer and more varied, please."
44,"Recomendado, pero tener en cuenta que es la 1era entrega. No lo tenian todo atado"
44,the one that started it all! And what a way to kick things off. A household Gem of the SEGA systems and the source of many childhood memories for me.
44,depois desse jogo..... teve vários outros jogos bons do sonic.
44,"Divertido e Simples, tudo que eu gosto."
44,"LIXO, jogo desgraçado\n                     \n                     level design PAVOROSO dps da green hill zone\n                     \n                     detestei e foi uma das experiencias que mais me irritou nessa franquia inteira (e olha que eu joguei sonic 2006)"
44,"A masterpiece of design more than it is an actually great game. At the same time, if you're competing with Mario, being able to have a style and sound profile that burns itself into a young mind is the only way to gain ground, since it's gonna be really hard to make up that distance mechanically."
45,It’s great game it’s very addicting and super cute! I recommend playing this in Nintendo. I rate this 5/5 starts! So worth playing it! I love it so much and I can’t believe there is such a gane so fun and addicting like this one
45,"It's so adorable! I've never played the name, but it looks adorable!"
45,"Im dying right now because it's so cute!!"
45,It is absolutely amazing I really will with no hesitation put 5 stars and 100 percent. Love the different breeds and the different activities that you can do with the dogs. The only thing is I think that you should be able to do more than 3 competitions.
46,"I talk mostly about Genesis shit on here but my\n                     \n                      real\n                     \n                     B&B in early childhood were portables. My fam was homeschooled 'til college, and for most of my early childhood, my older sister was a figure skater. The skater training regimen is a pipeline unto itself, these coaches had our mom driving her 40 minutes out of town at 5 in the morning multiple times a week. So until I was 11 or so, I spent the majority of school hours sitting in a cold rink lobby, either doing 'school' or playing GBA/DS."
46,BRING BACK R.O.B AND MISSIONS
46,I ran out of Double Dash so I played this and now I ran out of DS..\n                     \n                     DS is probably my favorite. It feels nicely balanced and pure and I like a lot of tracks in it. Also a lot of single player content
46,Childhood joy xx
46,distinctly remember feeling cooler than everyone for unlocking drybones when i was a kid
46,"i cant affirmate anything cuz could not have the opportunity to play the multiplayer, looks well made but i did not have the whole expierence, i may change the score in the future..."
47,freya te vejo como figura materna
47,i ruv !
47,One of the greatest games i have ever played.
47,Whenever I think about this game epic Norse music plays in my head
47,God Of War is a game that understands its audience. Kratos is now as tired and old as all of us who played the original games back on the PS2.
47,"One of the best games of the Ps4 generation, that game changes the style of GOW saga, and It hits in the middle of the target...It's a master piece. The story s deep, imersive, and the world of that GOW's so Vivid and Beautiful. I'm not sure If the New gameplays an upgrade, but It's enjoyable.\n                     \n                     9,6"
48,pretty fucking stellar
48,good one
48,mi nombre es john marston
48,Aye this is the one.
48,"And... oh, I got to tell you, it was perfect. Perfect. Everything, down to the last minute details."
48,My parents were oddly strict about me getting GTAIV so while I was waiting for my first proper GTA experience I managed to wrangle them into line just in time for Red Dead's release.
49,Anyone who actually enjoys this game needs shock therapy.
49,"oh man, nostalgia !"
49,Why Shephard why?
49,the best COD. People can try to tell you otherwise and there may be some objectively better made games since but the era surrounding this game when it came out was unmatched.
49,"Missed the multiplayer wave for this, so campaign is meh. Has 0 nostalgia value for me. One of the worse CoDs."
49,certified hood classic
